## Key Insights and Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following insights and recommendations were made:
1. **Trends in Injuries and Fatalities**: Observed fluctuations in injuries and fatalities over the years.
2. **Time of Day Impact**: Certain times of day show higher accident rates.
3. **Vulnerable Road Users**: Cyclists and pedestrians are particularly vulnerable.
4. **Geographical Patterns**: High-risk ZIP code areas identified.
5. **Contributing Factors**: Patterns in contributing factors for injuries and fatalities.

**Recommendations** include awareness campaigns, infrastructure improvements, policy revisions for vehicle safety, data-driven enforcement, and collaboration with local agencies.
